	Welcome to Cesspool!<br>
	The main idea of this site is complete anonymity. There are no accounts, and everyone could be anyone.<br>
	I, Owen Parker, take no responsibility for the content posted on this site, unless it's illegal. I delete illegal stuff.<br>
	This site is <i>ridiculously</i> easy to hack, so it may not last very long.<br>
	Oh, and it's incredibly ugly!<br>
